"""
Generators in Python provide a way to create iterators in a more memory-efficient manner. 
They allow you to iterate over data without loading the 
entire dataset into memory at once. Generators are defined using functions
and the yield statement.

# =============Using Generators for File Processing ==============
# Generators are especially useful for processing large files
# where loading the entire file into memory is impractical:

        for line in file:

# ===========Generator with yield from =================
# The yield from statement is used to delegate part of a 
# generatorâ€™s operations to another generator:
def generator1():
    yield from range(5)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()
    yield from range(5, 10)

# Using the generator
